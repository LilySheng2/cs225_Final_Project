## Communication

### Assistance
Teammates will contact each other on Discord. We expect all teammates to respond within 6 hours.


### Respect
* Expected to complete all work on time
* Everyone should be responsive and participate in the assignment
* Each group member should be prepared to give and receive constructive criticism on their work
* If one member is going to be absent, he/she should inform the other members
* Ask for help if you are struggling on your part of the assignment
* Do not interrupt when other teammate is speaking

## Tasks for each member: 
* Each member should be responsible for the team and should finish their work on time. 
* All the team members should contribute equally and work together to finally achieve the academic goal, in this case, to finish the graph algorithm project. 
* Scheduled Meeting Time(s): every Friday, 5:00pm - 6:00pm, in-person or Zoom
* NoteTaker: if meeting on Zoom, we will keep the transcript; if in-person meetings, Hongkun will be responsible of taking notes.

## Collaboration:

### Work Distribution
Hongkun will be responsible for BFS traversal for graphs and Dataset Read in/ Write out. Lily will be responsible for BFS(Breath First Search) to find the shortest path. Mike will be responsible for Highly Connected Subgraph clustering. If unexpected complications happen, the rest of the teammates will try to collaborate with her/him to finish the work on time.

### Time Commitment
10 hours per week is expected of each group member, each member should prepare and read the related materials before each meeting.

### Conflict Resolution
* We will set the agenda as a team, we will check the progress by the end of the meeting to ensure the team stays on track. 
* Important issues will be decided by a democracy vote. 
* Process and penalties for dealing with team issues:
* If a team member is absent for one meeting, the team will give the team member a warning. If the team member does not meet a due date on time, the team will also give the team member a warning. 
* If team members are absent for multiple meetings or do not meet due dates on time, we will bring it up to our mentor. 
* End-of-term agreement on using final peer assessment for grade adjustment: 
* This contract will hold a person accountable if they do not meet the rules. We as a team agree that our assessments of each other should be reflected in our grade.
